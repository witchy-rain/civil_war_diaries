<sal>Dear <pers role="recip">Nephew</pers>,</sal>

<body>
I have just seen <pers role="ref" job="captain" region="">Cap. Cowgil</pers> & learned where I could reach you by a letter. I was much pleased to hear your Captain speak so favorably of you as a brave soldier. Indeed he speaks in the highest terms of you. Don't be rash do your duty as a soldier, but donâ€™t necessarily expose yourself. Many a brave man has loss his life by an unnecessary exposure of his person. Be brave but not reclesly, dashing but prudent, heroic but always exercising sound judgement & discretion.

I have been here, at this port, for near two months, in command of <unit>the 133 Reg.</unit> one hundred days men. I will be in <place state="TN">Chattanooga</place> in a few days and will try & get down to the front. However this is very uncertain.

We leave here, on our return home about the middle of <date month="August">August</date> & in the mean time, I hope to get a letter from you. But if you do not get this soon, direct to <pers role="ref" job="" region="">Terre Haute</pers>, for I will be there after <date month="September">September</date>.

I do not forget the talk we had when I last saw you & in proper time will exert all the influence I have in your favor.
