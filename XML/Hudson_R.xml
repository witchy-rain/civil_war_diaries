<sal>Dear <pers role="recip">Nephew</pers>,</sal>

<body>
I have just seen <pers role="ref" job="captain" allegiance="u">Cap. Cowgil</pers> and learned where I could reach you by a letter. <emotion mood="happy">I was much pleased to hear your Captain speak so favorably of you as a brave soldier.</emotion> Indeed he speaks in the highest terms of you. Don't be rash do your duty as a soldier, but donâ€™t necessarily expose yourself. Many a brave man has loss his life by an unnecessary exposure of his person. Be brave but not reclesly, dashing but prudent, heroic but always exercising sound judgement and discretion.

I have been here, at this port, for near two months, in command of <unit>the 133 Reg.</unit> one hundred days men. I will be in <place state="TN">Chattanooga</place> in a few days and will try and get down to the front. However this is very uncertain.

<emotion mood="hopeful">We leave here, on our return home about the middle of <date month="August">August</date> and in the mean time, I hope to get a letter from you. But if you do not get this soon, direct to <place state="IN">Terre Haute</place>, for I will be there after <date month="September">September</date>.</emotion>

<emotion mood = "hopeful">I do not forget the talk we had when I last saw you and in proper time will exert all the influence I have in your favor.</emotion>
