<body>  
    Hearing that there is a mail going out this afternoon I thought I would improve the opportunity and write you a few lines.

    <emotion mood = "sad">I am sorry to tell you I am not very well at present. I was taken sick about three weeks ago with chronic diarhea, and have been in the hospital about a fortnight. I have been pretty sick but I am getting better now and hope to be well in a few days.</emotion>

    I would like to have you send me some things which will come better in a barrel than in anything else. I should like some good fresh eggs, a bottle of preserves, some lemons if you can get some good ones, some ginger root. Some butter would be very nice, it will come better in a tin can than in anything else. I would like some sugar too. I wish you would send a bottle of good Cider Vinegar also-

    I would like some pickled onions, and some dried apples. Some prepared chocalate would taste(?) first rate, as we do not get good tea and coffee.

    A towel and a couple of handkercheifs will be very acceptable also. If there is any room for anything else I wish that you would fill it up with onions and good sound apples that are not quite ripe that they will keep better.

Q M General</pers> <!--DD Tompkins Esquire assistant Quarter-master general -->No 6 State St. N.Y. Please send it as soon as possible.

    I have not heard from you since I have been here but should like to do so every mail. If convenient please send $5.00 the next time you write.
