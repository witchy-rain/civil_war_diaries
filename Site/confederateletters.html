      <p><i>Camp Dogwood</i></p>
      <p><u></u></p>
      <p>
         I recd the letter by B Hamner yesterday evening together with the "one thing needful". I am satisfied if you knew
         the pleasure you would give me by writing oftener and longer letters you would certainly
         take time and afford me the gratification. I suppose you have recd my letter informing
         you of the receipt of the "Chest" so it gave the boys no trouble. Since writing my
         last as I had anticipated we have had two battles. Floyd  fought and defeated the enemy near  Summersville  killing 60 and taking 101 prisoners while he suffered a loss of only 3 killed and
         twenty wounded. We took a company of "Ohio University Volunteers" from Oberlin University,
         it was reported last night that he had taken 60 more making a total of 161. On the
         25th (Sunday) the enemy (600 strong) caught about 75 of our cavalry in an ambush killing
         3 and wounding 18 , the news reached us about 12 oclock.M. Our regiment was formed and doublequicked
         6 1/2 miles, but Lo! when we reached the battle ground the terrified Yankees had fled
         after their glorious victory a few hours before. We are now within 2 1/2 miles of
         the enemy, having thrown up entrenchments and await an attack which I fear will never
         come. The superior officers say we can hold this place with 500 men against any force
         the enemy can send. They wont fight a fair fight but like cowardly indians fight in
         the bushes and not then unless they number 6 to one. Our boys have lately had several
         severe conflicts with the chickens and pigs in the neighbourhood, they are a savage
         race and gave indications of biting our boys, but Southern pluck was not to fall before
         so trifling a foe one of our men has just returned from the battle field bearing off
         seven of the wounded enemy. It is really amusing to see the Union mens fighting stock
         sacraficed to gratify the greedy maws of half fed veterans. We are now, and have been
         for a week on half rations, it is right hard to be sure but cant he helped just now
         and we are willing to submit to almost any hardship for the good of a cause on the
         success of which rests the rights and liberties of 8000000 of free men. The want of
         provision will I suppose be soon remedied as it is due in some degree to our hurried
         march and the uncertainty of the undertaking. I am sorry to hear so many of the poor
         wounded soldiers are dying — hope dear Mother you may be blessed with strenght and
         health to stand all that is required but whatever you do remember that you &amp; father
         must take care of yourselves. I hear that Bob is not chained during the day I suppose
         it is at his own request or else incident to the excitement of the times Bob always
         did recognize the principle that "liberty is dearer than life". Oh how dearly should
         I like to see my two darling little brothers, I used to think them troublesome when
         at home, but I have forgotten it all now and frequently feel sadly grieved at my past
         conduct to all of you, Should I life thro' this war it will have been of vast benefit
         to me. I will know the importance of home and feel with a keener relish the many kind
         offices which so endear me it to home me.
         Best love to Aunt [illeg] Millie and Grandma. Remember me to all inquiring friends. particularly to Mr &amp; Mrs Brown &amp; family. Before closing I must tell you I yesterday recd a letter from her majesty
         Julia [illeg] what prompted that piece of insanity I dont know, but I suppose she wished
         me to appreciate her literary acquirements and knew no better plan — let it go for
         what it's worth at a time like this our disposition should be friendly towards every
         one — We are all enjoying good health and working hard. I was fortunate enough to
         get in the mess with B Hamner and thereby secure the services of John — Kiss every one for me — <span class="happy">Remember me kindly to Dr McGuffey in particularly he it was who tickled my vanity by calling me Colonel —</span>

      <p><i>Kingston Tenn</i></p>
      <p><u></u></p>
      <p>
         I have just finished a letter to Mr Davis and one to Ma and have just one sheet of paper left which I must devote to my dear little Eva. But how shall I commence shall I begin at the beginning and tell you of all my adventures
         since the war began that would bore you I have no doubt So I will only give my expereience
         while in Kentucky. Just previous to our leaving Tennesee we were scouting near Nashville and succeeded in getting ourselves in several very neat little fights. <span class="triumphant">In these we allways came out successful We can lick the world skirmishing.</span> About the latter part of August our army commenced its march northward The Texas Rangers were put in the advance of course This is the post of honour as well as of danger
         when we are advancing on an enemy.<span class="triumphant"> In the present case it was indeed one of danger we had to fight the enemy every day.
            The first fight we had was near the state line here we ran into a Yankee Ambuscade
            and had a right sharp hand to hand fight we had to fall back though as the enemy outnumbered
            us two to one we made a good many go up before we did retreat though and took several
            prisoners I had quite a romantic adventure here.</span> I noticed one of the smallest specimens of humanity I ever saw fighting in the Yankee
         ranks. <span class="happy">The little nondescript was bolder than any of them and advanced so closer to our lines
            that I captured it and what do you suppose it was! Nothing in the world but a little
            fifteen year old girl dressed up in Yankee uniform she was right pretty and sharp
            as any full grown Yankee. [...] can assure you she was a curiosity We kept her two
            or three hours and then turned her loose. I wish we had a Barnum down south I would
            have sent her to him as a new specimen of the "genus homo.</span> From here we went directly on towards Bowling Green. But saw nothing more of the Yankees although we were within hearing of their drums
         all the time. When within eight or ten miles of town we halted to feed our horses
         and rest ourselves. <span class="triumphant">We had not been there more than an hour before we heard our pickets fire we mounted
            our horses immediately and went towards them before we got to them however I noticed
            a large dust to our right and very soon saw a large body of cavalry drawn up in line
            of battle We charged them immediately at full speed and they broke. They were some
            Georgia cavalry We did not find it out though until we were right on them I never
            heard such a yell in my life as they gave when they found out we were friends The
            Yankees had been chaseing them around all the morning.</span> We drew up in line of battle and awaited the gentlemens pleasure but no Yankees came.
         <span class="triumphant">We had no more fighting until we got to our old last winters battle field.—Woodsonville— Here we had a skirmish with the enemy loseing several men and killing some fifty
            Yankees. Our army captured five thousand prisoners at this place. We lay in ambush
            the next day and killed a great many of the enemy without the loss of a man.</span> <span class="defiant">After this we had no more fighting until we got within twenty miles of Louisville
            From hear Col Evans took a spy company of forty men and went to Taylorville a little village near the city I volunteered to go with him as it was a beautiful
            opening for an adventure of some kind. We went within two miles of the place that
            night and encamped for the mo About sun up next morning we dashed into town and found
            about three hundred Yankee cavalry there. haveing the gayest time immaginable impressing
            all the property and arresting the southern citizens But oh me how Yankee chivalry
            has degenerated.</span> <span class="triumphant">They skedaddled as if a thousand comanches were after them Col Evans and myself were rideing twenty or thirty steps ahead of the command when we entered
            town and were right on them before we were aware of it They fired on us but did not
            touch a man we returned the fire immediately and they broke as hard as they could
            go towards Louisville I saw an account of the affair in the Louisville Journal next morning They said they
            were attacked by three thousand rebel cavalry and repulsed them with great slaughter.</span> <span class="happy">You can immagine the reception we had from the ladies. I never saw people so rejoiced
            in my life. Beautiful young ladies actually kissed some our great rough rangers. They
            wanted to kiss me but I was so modest you know I refused I fared sumptualy here for
            three or four days.</span> Better than the ballance of the men as I was commisary Our camp was full of ladies
         all the time <span class="triumphant">This very circumstance very nearly caused us to be surprised we The camp was crowded
            one evening as usual when the enemy dashed down on our pickets and drove them in We
            men in the saddle immediately. The ladies gave us a cheer as we charged by them. How
            could we help but win the fight and we did do it in gallant style We drove the Yankees—twice
            our own number—back to their infantry and artillery.</span> <span class="triumphant">That night we were ordered to join our command at Mount Washington and got there just in time get into a most glorious little fight in which we were
            repulsed not though until we made many a blue coat bite the dust I had the pleasure
            of opening that fight myself I went out reconnoitering before the battle opened I
            found the enemy sooner than I expected and was within range of their guns before I
            knew it. Now I was in a nice scrape and hardly knew how to get out of it I concluded
            though I would give them one shot draw their fire and then get out of reach of their
            guns before they could load again. I took good aim and fired and then fell flat on
            the ground. They fired immediately but all the balls passed over me. My time from
            that immediate point was something bordering on the marvelous.</span> <span class="triumphant">On the next day they got in between us and our infantry In fact they had us surrounded
            by infantry artillery and cavalry. They were about four miles from us when we heard
            of them Col Wharton ordered us forward immediately in a gallope We very soon made the distance and found
            them sure enough Their cavalry, four regiments—about two thousand—drawn up in line
            of battle in an old field and immediately across the road. Their infantry and artillery
            was on the left. My company was in the advance we charged them immediately without
            [illeg] forming they let us get within ten steps of them and then turned loose a volley
            right in our faces this did not stop us a second we gave a yell you could hear for
            miles and run over and scattered them in every direction. This was the most complete
            victory I ever saw we killed forty or fifty of the enemy without the loss of a man.
            This was very strange considering we were fighting hand to hand.</span> I captured a good horse and and enough blankets for Ans and myself all the winter.
         <span class="triumphant">We went in directly then to Perryville where the big battle was fought I was in that but escaped without a scratch we charged
            two batteries. Col Evans the best friend I had in the regiment was shot here I brought him off the field.
            When our army commenced falling back from this place Gen Bragg gave me all the straggling cavalry and sent me a different route across the mountains.
            Before two days I had over a thousand men.</span> <span class="defeated">But no one can immagine how much we suffered We had nothing to eat for three days
            but parched corn and persimmons. Besides this the Bush whackers would fire on us from
            every thicket killing the men and horses.</span> I was rideing a very fine horse. They shot him the first fire.<span class="triumphant"> We caught some of them though and left them hanging on the side of the road.</span> <span class="happy">I am now staying at a Yankee Colonels house with a sick friend of mine. The lady is
            very kind to us she has not heard from her husband in a long time. Immagine me sitting
            in a handsome parlor dressed up in a Yankee captains uniform. And You can draw a very

            to get along without one;</span><span class="hopeful"> but I hope you will be able to get one some how be fore long.</span>
         There has been a great deal of Snow and rain this Spring, to day it is raining fast.
         This is a mountainous country, the land is good and People are generally wealthy,
         but it is a hard thing to get a meals victuals.
         I wish you had informed me what Amos did with his tobacco, whether he let Michael  have any or not.
         Genl Rosser  has given his brigade the name of Laurel Brigade, (in honour of having won Laurels
         of victory in almost every fight,) requesting the men to wear the leaf of the natural
         Shrub or the imitation thereof on their hats or coats. There is no talk of moveing
         camp at present. Tell Michael he must do all he can towards raising something to eat,
         if you can do nothing at home help your neighbour, if the conscripts will allow you.
         But I must close for the present

         To day is a leasure day with me and I will write you a few lines, which I have been
         intending to do for a long while, but have put off from time to time thinking every
         day I would write, but I find the old adage a true one, "Never put off for tomorrow
         that which can be done to day;" Though I knew that you heard from me through Parkie
         or Norton one, but that is not like writing some times myself.
         <span class="happy">I have been stationed in King George Co. every since the Middle of January last, I had a delightful time I formd a great many
            acquaintances &amp; they were all very kind to me, made me a great many presents such
            as socks, &amp; C, they were constantly sending me somthing good to Eat, which I stood
            in need of at times, for it was so very inconvenient for me to get my rations.</span> I was a regular church attendant, I was stationed not far from St; Paul's church
         where there was preaching every Sabbath.<span class="sad">I was very sorry when I had to leave, I received orders a few days ago to report here,
            Dick had received orders from Gen; Stuart to send him a portion of his Corps to Orange CH.o. and he wanted me as one of them
            to send, but Ben. &amp; myself persuaded him to allow us to remain with him, for I expect
            very soon to have traveling enough to do.</span> 
         How are you getting on house keeping &amp; how do you like Richmond, from all I can learn
         times must be very hard on you all, Every thing is so very high, but if you can make
         out to live you are better off than if you were in the country, Espicially if you
         were in old New Kent.<span class="digusted"> There you would not only have hard times to contend with, but you would have those
            vile retches to contend with, (the yankees) which is worse than all I think.</span> <span class="sad">I expect in a very short time the hold county will be filled with them, I see from
            to days papers that they are reported landing at west point, I feel very sorry for
            the citizens that are left down in that country, they are bound to suffer &amp; that badly,
            for they are doing much worse now than they have ever done before, every where, I
            feel very much for cousin Susan &amp; family I cant imagine what they will do, if they
            should bring up a large force.</span>
         <span class="happy">I hear from Mary  quite often, I am glad to hear she is so much pleased with her new situation &amp; the
            family whom she is with. She say's they are very kind to her.</span> I also hear that Parkie  has gotten a situation in the Dpt. in which Mary left, there was a rumour in circulation
         a few days ago that all the Clerks would be ordered to Columbia S. C. but I understand
         that the order has been countermanded, tho; I hardly expect Parkie would have been willing to have gone, she wrote me word that their pay had been increased,
         I am very glad to hear it. I did not think myself they were paying them enough, taking
         in consideration our Confederate money was of such little valure.
         How, and where is Nat , I suppose he is going to school some where. <span class="hopeful">Well; I must close my letter, tho I feel as if I could sit &amp;; talk to you a hold day
            without stoping. I want to see you all so much, I have no war news to write you, tho;
            I expect you hear a plenty of that in Richd I am very well indeed, enjoying fine health.
            We are getting a plenty of fine fish, do wish so much you had some of them, write
            to me, in one of your leasure hours. Good bye
            your affectionate Brother, Southy.</span>  
         <span class="sad">Give my love all with you &amp; at Sister H's when you see them I am sorry to hear sister
            H's health is so bad.</span> Also my love to them all at Brother Nortons, I would like to trade you some fish
         for some of your nice bread.

         Your letters by Lt Wilhelm  &amp; Ben Cauble  came to hand last night. <span class="happy">I was glad to hear from home.</span> I recd the comfort &amp; gloves I send the comfort back for I think they do more harm
         than good You need not send my over coat for I have enough to carry now there is a
         pistol in our Co for sale if I can get it for less than one ($100) hundred Dollars
         I will send it by the Lieut.
         <span class="afraid">Ma I witnessed something the other day that I never saw before &amp; never wish to see
            again one of our Brigade was shot for desertion poor fellow I could not help pitying
            him when he was marched around the Brigade we were formed in a hollow square he was
            placed upon his coffin and a white cloth placed over his eyes and then the command
            was given Ready. Aaim. Fire. and twelve rifles were discharged only six were loaded
            five balls struck him and the Dr dismounted at the discharge and examined his pulse
            and came back and reported him dead &amp; we were marched back to our quarters. oh it was awful.</span> Capt Cook  has arrived he says tell Pa  he must excuse him for not calling on him he met up with Lt Wilhelm &amp; did not have a chance to do so. <span class="happy">I think I would have laughed if I had been home at the time the prisoners broke loose
            ask Pa if his gun was loaded &amp; how many rounds of blank cartidges he had and if he
            had bayonets fixed or if he was scared much.</span>
         Abraham Morgan  is home on (30) thirty days furlough you can send me a box by him when he returns.
         If you can get those cloths I wrote about you will have an oportunity to send them.
         Tell Mrs Allen  if we are ordered to go we will do so but we dont want to be ordered again give my
