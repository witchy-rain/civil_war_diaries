         I take my pen in hand to in form you that I am well at present hoping that these few lines may find you all well and enjoying good health. We are all well
         at present and still here at Ceredo. I received your letters that you sent by Ephram and was glad to here that you was all well. I expected to have been home before this time but
         things has turned out so that I could not come but I think I will get to come now
         before long. I cant tell when we will leave here but I expect we will leave be fore
         long but I think I will get to come home first. The is some of our boys gone home
         now and I want to try and get a furlow as sune as they get back. Ephram brought me
         a piese of the wedding cake bak and I thought that it eat very well but the shugar
         suited my taste the best but the both suited my tast very well. I dont believe if
         it was not for som one a pasing by once and a while that I would never get a letter
         from home for I have never got but one letter that come by male yet. I suppose that
         Sam Love is above a common man or else he would wright once and a while to me. I have
         rote two or three letters to him and I dont intend to wright any more to him for I
         dont care for no one that dont care for me for I am jis as independent as any one.
         I have rote two or three letters to the Rebbs out in Jackson and the never rote any answers so let them git while they are yong and full of secesh
         let them go the will find out somday which way the money goes it goes the word. So
         nothing more at present but wright sune, John T Greer

         I have just seen Cap. Cowgil and learned where I could reach you by a letter. I was much pleased to hear your
         Captain speak so favorably of you as a brave soldier. Indeed he speaks in the highest
         terms of you. Don't be rash do your duty as a soldier, but don’t necessarily expose
         yourself. Many a brave man has loss his life by an unnecessary exposure of his person.
         Be brave but not reclesly, dashing but prudent, heroic but always exercising sound
         judgement and discretion.
         
         I have been here, at this port, for near two months, in command of the 133 Reg. one hundred days men. I will be in Chattanooga in a few days and will try and get down to the front. However this is very uncertain.
         
         We leave here, on our return home about the middle of August and in the mean time, I hope to get a letter from you. But if you do not get this
         soon, direct to Terre Haute, for I will be there after September.
         
         I do not forget the talk we had when I last saw you and in proper time will exert
         all the influence I have in your favor.

      <p><i>Arlington Hights, VAElkton,
            Cecil County, Md</i></p>
      <p><u>Brother</u></p>
      <p>Yours of the 31st of March came to hand yesterday after being on the road nearly two months, but you must not
         think I waited to get a letter from you before writing to you. The reason of my not
         writing to you was I have forgotten the number of your Brigade and Division and I
         am going to trust this by directing to the Regiment. Arlington Hights are on the Virginia
         side of the Potomac opposite Washington. We marched here from Appomattox Court House
         (the place of Lee's surrender). We camped about two weeks at Burkesville (the junction
         of the Petersburg and Lynchburg, and Richmond &amp; Danville Railroads). We marched from
         there direct by the way of Petersburg, Richmond, Bowling Green, and Fredericksburg.
         
         I suppose you will read in the papers that there is to be a review of the Army of
         the Potomac and Sherman's Army on the 23rd &amp; 24th insts (?). We expect then to be mustered out in a day or so. I guess as Ned is a
         recruit he will not get out for some time yet, but now the fighting is over all the
         troops that stay in the service will have good times. I think all the recruits will
         be mustered out in a month or so. By letters from home, I see that you and Wes Eckles
         were together at Winchester.  I suppose you didn't get to stay long together.  I hear
         that Wes is in Washington. I haven't seen him yet; we had a review coming through
         Richmond and were marched past Libby Prison, Castle Thunder, the State House, &amp; Lee
         and Davis Houses, etc.
         
         I suppose you are pretty well acquainted with all the incidents connected with the
         Campaign and there is no use of my relating them here.
         
         I intended to have gone to see you before going home if you had stayed at Cumberland,
         but as you have moved, I will wait and see where you are going to be located, for
         I hear that the Government is going to retain the Veterans; after being in Service
         2 years and 9 months I have only climbed the Ladder of Fame high enough to be an Orderly
         Sergeant which I have the honor to be now. I suppose to become famous I shall have
         to do something like Booth the assassion; the last letter I had from home they were
         all well. Ned received a letter from you (in my care) at Richmond. Slim Eckles is
         not well yet. Ben Bogia send his respects to you. Ned sends his love to you to which
         I add my own.</p>

      <p><u>Mattie</u></p>
      <p>Just a few moments since a letter was received by John from you, through the kindness of our mutual friend Genl Buckner, which was sent to Genl Burnside's to be forwarded. You cant imagine the gratification it gave us to hear of from our dear sister Mattie, aside from the pleasure plainly demonstrated by her husband. How anxiously we look forward to the arrival of the Mails,  ravenously do we devour its contents. It is the very greatest pleasure we have— I have no doubt ere this you have heard
         of our imprisonment in the Ohio State Penitentiary. About the 1st of Aug. about 70 officers of our command, were removed to this place. At first our confinement was almost unbearable,
         
         
         
         but since we have been found to be gentlemen (as expressed by the Penitentiary Warden) we have been treated exceedingly well. On Sunday's we are confined in our cells all day, excepting 2 hours in the morning
          one in the afternoon, the balance of the week we are permitted to be together from
         7 A M till 6 P. M. which gives us plenty of time to converse  exercise; We also have the priviledge (those who have "Green Backs") of purchasing
         whatever delicasies in the shape of eadibles  under clothing we want. Taking into consideration the clenliness conveniences  many other luxuries which we have here, I have no doubt that we are better off than
         any other p Confederate prisoners now in confinement in the U S. barring the idea
         of being in a Penitentiary. for which we care very little. being put here for merely stealing Horses, We receive
         letters daily from our friends at
         
         
         
         home, generally accompanied with a box of something nice to eat. The only thing aside from our imprisonment of which we complain, is the want of outer
         garments, which priviledge is granted those in other prisons. this restriction I hope will soon be removed if properly represented to the officer
         regulating this matter. We hear from Ma daily. At first she suffered no doubt inexpressebly—but since she finds that we are so comfortable,
          in such fine spirits, her suffering has been relieved proportionately. She writes almost daily to all of us,  speaks of visiting us soon. which priviledge I trust may be granted her, Basil Charlton  I saw her at Cincinnatti for an hour, when we first arrived there. Genl Burnside granted this priviledge in consideration of some little kindness shown his ADC. Capt Pell by myself when a prisoner at our Head Quarters at the battle of Manassas
         
         
         
         when chief of Staff of Genl A. P. Hill— In your letter you ask "What has become of Foster Cheatham" I can tell you, he is now sitting in front of my apartments looking fatter and better
         than you ever saw him. I am almost ashamed to admit it, but really I am glad that he is a prisoner. he is such good company for us. I wrote Genl Hill from this place some time since, but whether the letter reached him, I cant say. so please write Dolly as soon as you get this. and direct your letter to care I. Booton Hill Richmond Va. giving her all the news. we have all I believe written to Tommy. You do so also if you please, which I know you will do — Charlton is in daily communication with Miss Williams,  I with somebody else, not quite so often as once a day, but fully as satisfactory,
         I have a nice present for you, which I hope to deliver in person soon in shape of
         a carte de visique of somebody</p>

         I am injoying good health and hope this will find you injoying the same. John Sanborn is in the hospital at Beaufort Hospital No 9. I have a letter from him every week he is a getting along first rate.
         They have promoted John to Corporal he dont know it yet. I am going to write to John to night I am going to direct it Corp. Sanborn he wont know what it means. They have commenced on Fort Sumter again. They have been bombarding it for five days and nights. I was on picket at
         Fort Gregg yesterday. They shot away the flag on Fort Sumter twice the first time they shot it away a Reb come up on top of the fort and begun to wave it and put the flag up in the afternoon
         they shot is away again. When the Reb come up to put it up away went our guns at him bang bang bang. I guess that fellow went
         to his long home. They havnt put up the flag yet. They will charge on it before many days. Fitzgerald has got his discharge and gone home perhaps you will hear about him before you get
         this. I dont think of anything more to write this time so I will close.

         Hearing that there is a mail going out this afternoon I thought I would improve the
         opportunity and write you a few lines.
         
         I am sorry to tell you I am not very well at present. I was taken sick about three
         weeks ago with chronic diarhea, and have been in the hospital about a fortnight. I
         have been pretty sick but I am getting better now and hope to be well in a few days.
         
         I would like to have you send me some things which will come better in a barrel than
         in anything else. I should like some good fresh eggs, a bottle of preserves, some
         lemons if you can get some good ones, some ginger root. Some butter would be very
         nice, it will come better in a tin can than in anything else. I would like some sugar
         too. I wish you would send a bottle of good Cider Vinegar also-
         
         I would like some pickled onions, and some dried apples. Some prepared chocalate would
         taste(?) first rate, as we do not get good tea and coffee.
         
         A towel and a couple of handkercheifs will be very acceptable also. If there is any
         room for anything else I wish that you would fill it up with onions and good sound
         apples that are not quite ripe that they will keep better. Direct to the care of Capt. Sanford, Co C, 7th Regt. Conn Vols. _____ DD Tompkins Esq Asst. Q M General No 6 State St. N.Y. Please send it as soon as possible.
         
         I have not heard from you since I have been here but should like to do so every mail.

      <p>
         I take my pen in hand to inform you that I am well at present and hope that those
         few line may find you enjoying the same blessing. I started at soldiering beter than two months ago. I inlisted in a company calledCo. F 149 Reg. P.B.V.  We are now in a camp calledcamp McNeal on Meridian hill near the sity of Washington. We are not near all the time in camp. We are the most of the time
         out to guard hospittle at town and other places part of the regiment has moved there
         tents to town, I expect that hour company will move before this weak is out, but I
         do not no for sure; it has bin warm and dry ever since we have bin down here until
         last fri night about 1 o’clock, it comenced raining and poured it down untill about
         four. I had to go on guard at four so I got shet of standing in the rain for that
         night since that night it has fellt like husking corn it is raining this after noon.
         
         I am in my tent my seat is a knapsack, my deck is a portfolio this is as good a seat
         as I ever git. Without it is a chore. It is said that he that is born of Woman  and
         inlisteth in the 149 Reg Co. F, his days are few and short of rations. He cometh forth
         tato and retireth at rollcall much soldiering hath made him sharp, yea, even so that
         the sete of his britches is in danger of being cut through. They are all honest, they
         take nothing that they cannot reach they capture the most butifull prize packages
         of paper and walk off rejoicing.
         
         The boys are all brothers and work to each others honor. They as grate set of fellows
         for fun and have all the furnishings able for what one dont know another do and so
         they have some thing a going all the time. So the time goes I can’t tell whare if
         it gets wet and mayby it won’t be quite so nice as it has bin since we have bin down
         here. No more at present. I send my Respects to all inquiring friends. Tell all that
         inquires after me that I want them to write to and I will answer those leters as soon

         I take this opportunity of writing these few lines to let you know that I am well
         and hope you and all the rest are the same. We are still at the same place and not
         doing much in the fighting line. A part of McCalls division next to us on our right
         had a Battle with the enemy last friday and the rebels were routed with severe loss.
         It was not our luck to be in the muss we were drawn up in line of Battle impatiently
         listening to the cannonading and waiting for our General who was at Washington he
         came back on full gallop but the fight was then over however he was highly pleased
         to see us out so ready and such good numbers we gave him three cheers and says he
         boys you turn out some when there is a prospect of a fight if you dont on drill says
         he I thought you were a whole Division. The fact is so much drilling is about played
         out and we play the old Soger(?) all ways to get rid of it.
         We ran out 3 or 4 miles yesterday expecting a fight but we came across no rebels the
         Majors Orderly saw fifteen rebel Cavalry thats generally our luck we go out cheering and in the
         best of spirits and come back cussing and swearing we have had very fine weather but
         to day it is pretty rough and a little snow falling no more at present.

         To day is a leasure day with me and I will write you a few lines, which I have been
         intending to do for a long while, but have put off from time to time thinking every
         day I would write, but I find the old adage a true one, "Never put off for tomorrow
         that which can be done to day;" Though I knew that you heard from me through Parkie
         or Norton one, but that is not like writing some times myself.
         I have been stationed in King George Co. every since the Middle of January last, I had a delightful time I formd a great many
         acquaintances &amp; they were all very kind to me, made me a great many presents such
         as socks, &amp; C, they were constantly sending me somthing good to Eat, which I stood
         in need of at times, for it was so very inconvenient for me to get my rations. I was a regular church attendant, I was stationed not far from St; Paul's church
         where there was preaching every Sabbath.I was very sorry when I had to leave, I received orders a few days ago to report here,
         Dick had received orders from Gen; Stuart to send him a portion of his Corps to Orange CH.o. and he wanted me as one of them
         to send, but Ben. &amp; myself persuaded him to allow us to remain with him, for I expect
         very soon to have traveling enough to do. 
         How are you getting on house keeping &amp; how do you like Richmond, from all I can learn
         times must be very hard on you all, Every thing is so very high, but if you can make
         out to live you are better off than if you were in the country, Espicially if you
         were in old New Kent. There you would not only have hard times to contend with, but you would have those
         vile retches to contend with, (the yankees) which is worse than all I think. I expect in a very short time the hold county will be filled with them, I see from
         to days papers that they are reported landing at west point, I feel very sorry for
         the citizens that are left down in that country, they are bound to suffer &amp; that badly,
         for they are doing much worse now than they have ever done before, every where, I
         feel very much for cousin Susan &amp; family I cant imagine what they will do, if they
         should bring up a large force.
         I hear from Mary [i.e., Mary E. Savage, the author's sister] quite often, I am glad
         to hear she is so much pleased with her new situation &amp; the family whom she is with.
         She say's they are very kind to her. I also hear that Parkie [i.e., Maria Parker Savage, the author's sister] has gotten
         a situation in the Dpt. in which Mary left, there was a rumour in circulation a few
         days ago that all the Clerks would be ordered to Columbia S. C. but I understand that
         the order has been countermanded, tho; I hardly expect Parkie would have been willing
         to have gone, she wrote me word that their pay had been increased, I am very glad
         to hear it. I did not think myself they were paying them enough, taking in consideration
         our Confederate money was of such little valure.
         How, and where is Nat [i.e., Nathaniel L. Savage (b. 1854), the author's son], I suppose
         he is going to school some where. Well; I must close my letter, tho I feel as if I
         could sit &amp;; talk to you a hold day without stoping. I want to see you all so much,
         I have no war news to write you, tho; I expect you hear a plenty of that in Richd
         I am very well indeed, enjoying fine health. We are getting a plenty of fine fish,
         do wish so much you had some of them, write to me, in one of your leasure hours. Good
         bye
         your affectionate Brother, Southy.  
         Give my love all with you &amp; at Sister H's when you see them I am sorry to hear sister
         H's health is so bad. Also my love to them all at Brother Nortons, I would like to
         trade you some fish for some of your nice bread.

         the soldiers have gone to se this Natural curiosity, owing to my ill health I have
         not yet been able to go, but if nothing occurs to prevent me I Shall go in a day or
         two to behold the wonderful works of nature in Bridge building. 
         James Whetzel [i.e., Pvt. James G. Whetzell, Co. H, 11th Virginia Cavalry], arrived here on the 1st of april tell his folks if you See them that he got here
         Safe and that he is now well and as Jolly as ever. He Says that they had heard at
         home that George Wigginton [i.e., Pvt. George W. Wigginton, Co. A, 7th Virginia Cavalry] had been Sick. Wether he has been Sick or not I cannot tell, but he is well now and
         doing duty. I am Sorry father cannot get a horse, and indeed I cannot tell how you will manage to get along without one; but I hope you will be able to get one some how be fore long.
         There has been a great deal of Snow and rain this Spring, to day it is raining fast.
         This is a mountainous country, the land is good and People are generally wealthy,
         but it is a hard thing to get a meals victuals.
         I wish you had informed me what Amos did with his tobacco, whether he let Michael [i.e., Michael White] have any or not.
         Genl Rosser [i.e., Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Rosser, C.S.A.] has given his brigade the name of Laurel Brigade, (in honour of having won Laurels
         of victory in almost every fight,) requesting the men to wear the leaf of the natural
         Shrub or the imitation thereof on their hats or coats. There is no talk of moveing
         camp at present. Tell Michael he must do all he can towards raising something to eat,
         if you can do nothing at home help your neighbour, if the conscripts will allow you.
         But I must close for the present
