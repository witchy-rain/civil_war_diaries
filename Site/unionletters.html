      <p>Dear Sister Mary</p>

      <p>
         <span class="happy">I take this opportunity of writing these few lines to let you know that I am well
            and hope you and all the rest are the same.</span> We are still at the same place and not doing much in the fighting line. <span class="triumphant">A part of McCalls division next to us on our right had a Battle with the enemy last
            friday and the rebels were routed with severe loss. It was not our luck to be in the
            muss we were drawn up in line of Battle impatiently listening to the cannonading and
            waiting for our General who was at Washington he came back on full gallop but the
            fight was then over however he was highly pleased to see us out so ready and such
            good numbers we gave him three cheers and says he boys you turn out some when there
            is a prospect of a fight if you dont on drill says he I thought you were a whole Division.</span> The fact is so much drilling is about played out and we play the old Soger(?) all
         ways to get rid of it.
         <span class="triumphant">We ran out 3 or 4 miles yesterday expecting a fight but we came across no rebels the
            Majors Orderly saw fifteen rebel Cavalry thats generally our luck we go out cheering and in the
            best of spirits and come back cussing and swearing we have had very fine weather but
            to day it is pretty rough and a little snow falling no more at present.</span>

         Hearing that there is a mail going out this afternoon I thought I would improve the
         opportunity and write you a few lines.
         
         <span class="sad">I am sorry to tell you I am not very well at present. I was taken sick about three

            have been pretty sick but I am getting better now and hope to be well in a few days.</span>
         
         I would like to have you send me some things which will come better in a barrel than
         in anything else. I should like some good fresh eggs, a bottle of preserves, some
         lemons if you can get some good ones, some ginger root. Some butter would be very
         nice, it will come better in a tin can than in anything else. I would like some sugar
         too. I wish you would send a bottle of good Cider Vinegar also-
         
         I would like some pickled onions, and some dried apples. Some prepared chocalate would
         taste(?) first rate, as we do not get good tea and coffee.
         
         A towel and a couple of handkercheifs will be very acceptable also. If there is any
         room for anything else I wish that you would fill it up with onions and good sound
         apples that are not quite ripe that they will keep better. Direct to the care of Capt. Sanford, Co C, 7th Regt. Conn Vols. _____ DD Tompkins Esq Asst. Q M General No 6 State St. N.Y. Please send it as soon as possible.

      <p>My dear Wife &amp; boy,</p>
      <p><u></u></p>
      <p>
         At length the prohibition of letter writing has been removed by General Grant &amp; mail is to go out 8 o'clock this morning. I hasten to improve the first opportunity
         I have had for more than two weeks in talking with my wife &amp; boy. I last wrote your
         Apr 25th from Perkin's Plantation, La., though I doubt whether you received the letters, I am informed that our letters
         have been stopped at Memphis fore some time past. I wrote you again the 26th but finding no letters were allowed
         to go north, I put his letter in my trunk. Since that time we have witnessed &amp; participated
         in stirring scenes. <span class="triumphant">The battle of "Magnolia Hills" has been fought &amp; a glorious victory won. Hundreds
            have fallen on my every side but I am still spared unharmed to my wife &amp; boy.</span> I have not sufficient paper to enable me to give a detailed account of the fight,
         but I will hereafter. <span class="triumphant">We were in the fight from early in the morning till dark. The enemy's first shot was
            fired at Co. C. (we with three other companies were skirmishing in front of our left) the shell struck
            the ground &amp; burst at the very feet of several men in my second platoon. The second
            shell I saw was aimed higher. I instantly ordered the boys to lie down &amp; did so myself,
            but not a moment too soon, for the shell passed directly over me so near as to force
            my cap upon the back of my head, this to when it was strapped tightly under my chin.
            The shock made my head fairly numb for an instant. I then brought my boys more to
            the front nearer the enemy but when we were protected by a slight rise of ground in
            front. Here we were comparatively safe till we were relieved by Gen. Osterhaus, when we rejoined our regiment on the right. Soon after we were again in the thickest
            of the fight. Our brigade (Benton's) gained the first success of the day as we soon
            forced back the troops opposed to us, taking many prisoners. two excellent cannon
            &amp; caissons, ammunition trains, horses &amp;c besides killing their General Stacey which they say was the work of the 33rd. But I was not going to particulars in this
            letter. Our loss in killed &amp; wounded was about 1000. No one in my company was hurt
            but Bush. He was struck twice though but slightly hurt. When you consider he stands directly
            behind me in the ranks you will see that it was rather narrow dodging for me.</span> That we were pretty well tired out when night came you can well imagine. <span class="happy">I think I never knew hunger, thirst &amp; fatigue before--but I lay down that night under
            one of our faithful guns &amp; blessed God that He had given success to our arms &amp; spared
            your husband &amp; father to his darling wife &amp; boy. He has been very good to us--let
            us love &amp; praise him more than ever before.</span> <span class="triumphant">With the early light of the next day we again advanced skirmishing through dense canebrake
            but no enemy could be found. They fled in confusion through Port Gibson. &amp; were far on the road back to Vicksburg to make the city quake with the doleful tale. Hundreds of prisoners they had left
            in our hands &amp; hundreds of dead &amp; wounded on the bloody field. We are now slowly &amp;
            surely closing up behind the doomed city &amp; in a few days it will be ours. Then the
            Mississippi will be opened to the commerce of the north &amp; a bright day will dawn upon
            our afflicted country.</span>
         I have received no letters from you__ Continue to write &amp; direct as before (only isCarr's
         instead ofKarr's Division--the mistake was mine). <span class="hopeful">Do not be too anxious about me. Trust in God he is good &amp; will do right.</span> <span class="happy">Harry, Papa often thinks of his little boy &amp; would love to be with him &amp; Mama &amp; walk
            out with him this pleasant morning. But Papa must stay &amp; help "shoot the rebels" a
            little longer. Someday Papa hopes he can come home &amp; stay with Harry &amp; Mama. Harry will be a good boy &amp; love &amp; take care of Mama won't he? Give lots of love
            to Daniel &amp; Phila &amp; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Henley. Also to John &amp; Villa when you see them.</span> <span class="triumphant">Doubtless before this reaches you all cause for further writing will be removed for
            Vicksburg will be ours.</span> <span class="happy">Take good care of yourself. Walk out often with Harry &amp; do not let anxiety on my account
            depress you spirits. I sent you a flower which I plucked on the battle field while
            skirmishing with the enemy. God bless you in all things my darling wife &amp; boy.</span>

         before a letter gets there. <span class="defiant">I will just say that we have the Weldon railroad and if old Lee gets it back he has something of a job before him.</span> The 5th Corps were fortifying very strongly on the railroad and a part of the 2nd Corps came down as a support yesterday, and I was told that Butler's corps was back of
         us but I think that a mistake. I came here today but before I came I got six letters.
         One from you and Delinda  and one from Sergt. Arnold . those were all I cared for at all. the others were business letters and business
         has but few charms for me as I feel now. I feel all the interest in the business at
         home that I ever did but this business here is not of a kind to make one love it.
         <span class="happy">I was very pleased as usual to hear from you -- to get a letter written by your own
            hand. I dont know what I should do if I did not hear from home oftener than a great
            part of our boys do.</span> <span class="bittersweet">I am here to fight for those at home that I love and if they did not prize my services,
            and life it may, sufficiently to write to cheer me I fear I should sink. I agree with
            you that it is mostly unpleasant here but there are some pleasant things even here
            sometimes.</span> <span class="afraid">There never was such a campaign before since the creation of the world as we have
            been passing through this season. I trust it is the last such one the world will ever
            know like it.</span> <span class="hopeful">I hope to be spared to return to you and I feel as if I should but this world is not
            intended as a state of perfect bliss. Thank God. He has prepared a world of perfect
            bliss and I trust we will both enjoy it. We will if I am not deceived in my hope.
            I love to look forward to our meeting on earth. I shall be so glad to see you and
            clasp you in my arms once more. Every thing about there seems pleasant by contrast
            to think of even those that I used to dislike. I wish they would rush the men down
            here and I believe this thing might be settled up pretty soon.</span> <span class="bittersweet">I expect to be able to go back to the Regt. in a few days but I dont intend to hurry.
            I dont feel that our Regt has been used right. that makes a difference with me.</span>

      <p><i>Arlington Hights, VA</i></p>
      <p>Dear Brother</p>
      <p><u></u></p>
      <p>Yours of the 31st of March came to hand yesterday after being on the road nearly two months, but you must not
         think I waited to get a letter from you before writing to you. The reason of my not
         writing to you was I have forgotten the number of your Brigade and Division and I
         am going to trust this by directing to the Regiment. Arlington Hights are on the Virginia
         side of the Potomac opposite Washington. We marched here from Appomattox Court House
         (the place of Lee's surrender). We camped about two weeks at Burkesville (the junction
         of the Petersburg and Lynchburg, and Richmond &amp; Danville Railroads). We marched from
         there direct by the way of Petersburg, Richmond, Bowling Green, and Fredericksburg.
         
         <span class="hopeful">I suppose you will read in the papers that there is to be a review of the Army of
            the Potomac and Sherman's Army on the 23rd &amp; 24th insts (?). We expect then to be
            mustered out in a day or so. I guess as Ned is a recruit he will not get out for some
            time yet, but now the fighting is over all the troops that stay in the service will
            have good times. I think all the recruits will be mustered out in a month or so.</span> By letters from home, I see that you and Wes Eckles were together at Winchester.
         I suppose you didn't get to stay long together.  I hear that Wes is in Washington.
         I haven't seen him yet; we had a review coming through Richmond and were marched past
         Libby Prison, Castle Thunder, the State House, &amp; Lee and Davis Houses, etc.
         
         I suppose you are pretty well acquainted with all the incidents connected with the
         Campaign and there is no use of my relating them here.
         
         I intended to have gone to see you before going home if you had stayed at Cumberland,
         but as you have moved, I will wait and see where you are going to be located, for
         I hear that the Government is going to retain the Veterans;<span class="bittersweet"> after being in Service 2 years and 9 months I have only climbed the Ladder of Fame
            high enough to be an Orderly Sergeant which I have the honor to be now. I suppose
            to become famous I shall have to do something like Booth the assassion;</span><span class="hopeful"> the last letter I had from home they were all well.</span> Ned received a letter from you (in my care) at Richmond. <span class="sad">Slim Eckles is not well yet.</span> Ben Bogia send his respects to you. Ned sends his love to you to which I add my own.</p>
      <p>    
         I will close by signing myself your affectionate brother,
         
         George
         
         PS You can direct in about a week  to
         
         Geo W. Johnson, Jr.
         Elkton,
         Cecil County, Md
         
         May 21st: I didn't get this in the mail yesterday; there is nothing new. I am going
         to commence making out our muster-out rolls tomorrow.
