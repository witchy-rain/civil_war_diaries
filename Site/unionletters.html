            and hope you and all the rest are the same.</span> We are still at the same place and not doing much in the fighting line. <span class="triumphant">A part of McCalls division next to us on our right had a Battle with the enemy last
            friday and the rebels were routed with severe loss. It was not our luck to be in the
            muss we were drawn up in line of Battle impatiently listening to the cannonading and
            waiting for our General who was at Washington he came back on full gallop but the
            fight was then over however he was highly pleased to see us out so ready and such
            good numbers we gave him three cheers and says he boys you turn out some when there
            is a prospect of a fight if you dont on drill says he I thought you were a whole Division.</span> The fact is so much drilling is about played out and we play the old Soger(?) all
         ways to get rid of it.
         <span class="triumphant">We ran out 3 or 4 miles yesterday expecting a fight but we came across no rebels the
            Majors Orderly saw fifteen rebel Cavalry thats generally our luck we go out cheering and in the
            best of spirits and come back cussing and swearing we have had very fine weather but
            to day it is pretty rough and a little snow falling no more at present.</span>

         Hearing that there is a mail going out this afternoon I thought I would improve the
         opportunity and write you a few lines.
         
         <span class="sad">I am sorry to tell you I am not very well at present. I was taken sick about three

         I would like to have you send me some things which will come better in a barrel than
         in anything else. I should like some good fresh eggs, a bottle of preserves, some
         lemons if you can get some good ones, some ginger root. Some butter would be very
         nice, it will come better in a tin can than in anything else. I would like some sugar
         too. I wish you would send a bottle of good Cider Vinegar also-
         
         I would like some pickled onions, and some dried apples. Some prepared chocalate would
         taste(?) first rate, as we do not get good tea and coffee.
         
         A towel and a couple of handkercheifs will be very acceptable also. If there is any
         room for anything else I wish that you would fill it up with onions and good sound
         apples that are not quite ripe that they will keep better. Direct to the care of Capt. Sanford, Co C, 7th Regt. Conn Vols. _____ DD Tompkins Esq Asst. Q M General No 6 State St. N.Y. Please send it as soon as possible.

      <p>Yours of the 31st of March came to hand yesterday after being on the road nearly two months, but you must not
         think I waited to get a letter from you before writing to you. The reason of my not
         writing to you was I have forgotten the number of your Brigade and Division and I
         am going to trust this by directing to the Regiment. Arlington Hights are on the Virginia
         side of the Potomac opposite Washington. We marched here from Appomattox Court House
         (the place of Lee's surrender). We camped about two weeks at Burkesville (the junction
         of the Petersburg and Lynchburg, and Richmond &amp; Danville Railroads). We marched from
         there direct by the way of Petersburg, Richmond, Bowling Green, and Fredericksburg.
         
         <span class="hopeful">I suppose you will read in the papers that there is to be a review of the Army of
            the Potomac and Sherman's Army on the 23rd &amp; 24th insts (?). We expect then to be
            mustered out in a day or so. I guess as Ned is a recruit he will not get out for some
            time yet, but now the fighting is over all the troops that stay in the service will
            have good times. I think all the recruits will be mustered out in a month or so.</span> By letters from home, I see that you and Wes Eckles were together at Winchester.
         I suppose you didn't get to stay long together.  I hear that Wes is in Washington.
         I haven't seen him yet; we had a review coming through Richmond and were marched past
         Libby Prison, Castle Thunder, the State House, &amp; Lee and Davis Houses, etc.
         
         I suppose you are pretty well acquainted with all the incidents connected with the
         Campaign and there is no use of my relating them here.
         
         I intended to have gone to see you before going home if you had stayed at Cumberland,
         but as you have moved, I will wait and see where you are going to be located, for
         I hear that the Government is going to retain the Veterans;<span class="bittersweet"> after being in Service 2 years and 9 months I have only climbed the Ladder of Fame
