         I take my pen in hand to in form you that I am well at present hoping that these few lines may find you all well and enjoying good health. We are all well
         at present and still here at Ceredo. I received your letters that you sent by Ephram and was glad to here that you was all well. I expected to have been home before this time but
         things has turned out so that I could not come but I think I will get to come now
         before long. I cant tell when we will leave here but I expect we will leave be fore
         long but I think I will get to come home first. The is some of our boys gone home
         now and I want to try and get a furlow as sune as they get back. Ephram brought me
         a piese of the wedding cake bak and I thought that it eat very well but the shugar
         suited my taste the best but the both suited my tast very well. I dont believe if
         it was not for som one a pasing by once and a while that I would never get a letter
         from home for I have never got but one letter that come by male yet. I suppose that
         Sam Love is above a common man or else he would wright once and a while to me. I have
         rote two or three letters to him and I dont intend to wright any more to him for I
         dont care for no one that dont care for me for I am jis as independent as any one.
         I have rote two or three letters to the Rebbs out in Jackson and the never rote any answers so let them git while they are yong and full of secesh
         let them go the will find out somday which way the money goes it goes the word. So
         nothing more at present but wright sune, John T Greer

      <p><u></u></p>
      <p>
         I have just seen Cap. Cowgil and learned where I could reach you by a letter. I was much pleased to hear your
         Captain speak so favorably of you as a brave soldier. Indeed he speaks in the highest
         terms of you. Don't be rash do your duty as a soldier, but donâ€™t necessarily expose
         yourself. Many a brave man has loss his life by an unnecessary exposure of his person.
         Be brave but not reclesly, dashing but prudent, heroic but always exercising sound
         judgement and discretion.
         
         I have been here, at this port, for near two months, in command of the 133 Reg. one hundred days men. I will be in Chattanooga in a few days and will try and get down to the front. However this is very uncertain.
         
         We leave here, on our return home about the middle of August and in the mean time, I hope to get a letter from you. But if you do not get this
         soon, direct to Terre Haute, for I will be there after September.
         
         I do not forget the talk we had when I last saw you and in proper time will exert
         all the influence I have in your favor.

      <p><i>Arlington Hights, VA</i></p>
      <p><u>Dear Brother</u></p>
      <p>Yours of the 31st of March came to hand yesterday after being on the road nearly two
         months, but you must not think I waited to get a letter from you before writing to
         you. The reason of my not writing to you was I have forgotten the number of your Brigade
         and Division and I am going to trust this by directing to the Regiment. Arlington
         Hights are on the Virginia side of the Potomac opposite Washington. We marched here
         from Appomattox Court House (the place of Lee's surrender). We camped about two weeks
         at Burkesville (the junction of the Petersburg and Lynchburg, and Richmond and Danville
         Railroads). We marched from there direct by the way of Petersburg, Richmond, Bowling
         Green, and Fredericksburg.
         
         I suppose you will read in the papers that there is to be a review of the Army of
         the Potomac and Sherman's Army on the 23rd and 24th insts (?). We expect then to be
         mustered out in a day or so. I guess as Ned is a recruit he will not get out for some
         time yet, but now the fighting is over all the troops that stay in the service will
         have good times. I think all the recruits will be mustered out in a month or so. By
         letters from home, I see that you and Wes Eckles were together at Winchester.  I suppose
         you didn't get to stay long together.  I hear that Wes is in Washington. I haven't
         seen him yet; we had a review coming through Richmond and were marched past Libby
         Prison, Castle Thunder, the State House, and Lee and Davis Houses, etc.
         
         I suppose you are pretty well acquainted with all the incidents connected with the
         Campaign and there is no use of my relating them here.
         
         I intended to have gone to see you before going home if you had stayed at Cumberland,
         but as you have moved, I will wait and see where you are going to be located, for
         I hear that the Government is going to retain the Veterans; after being in Service
         2 years and 9 months I have only climbed the Ladder of Fame high enough to be an Orderly
         Sergeant which I have the honor to be now. I suppose to become famous I shall have
         to do something like Booth the assassion; the last letter I had from home they were
         all well. Ned received a letter from you (in my care) at Richmond. Slim Eckles is
         not well yet. Ben Bogia send his respects to you. Ned sends his love to you to which
         I add my own and I will close by signing myself your affectionate brother,

         I am injoying good health and hope this will find you injoying the same. John Sanborn is in the hospital at Beaufort Hospital No 9. I have a letter from him every week he is a getting along first rate.
         They have promoted John to Corporal he dont know it yet. I am going to write to John to night I am going to direct it Corp. Sanborn he wont know what it means. They have commenced on Fort Sumter again. They have been bombarding it for five days and nights. I was on picket at
         Fort Gregg yesterday. They shot away the flag on Fort Sumter twice the first time they shot it away a Reb come up on top of the fort and begun to wave it and put the flag up in the afternoon
         they shot is away again. When the Reb come up to put it up away went our guns at him bang bang bang. I guess that fellow went
         to his long home. They havnt put up the flag yet. They will charge on it before many days. Fitzgerald has got his discharge and gone home perhaps you will hear about him before you get
         this. I dont think of anything more to write this time so I will close.

      <p><u>My Dear Mother,</u></p>
      <p>  
         Hearing that there is a mail going out this afternoon I thought I would improve the
         opportunity and write you a few lines.
         
         I am sorry to tell you I am not very well at present. I was taken sick about three
         weeks ago with chronic diarhea, and have been in the hospital about a fortnight. I
         have been pretty sick but I am getting better now and hope to be well in a few days.
         
         I would like to have you send me some things which will come better in a barrel than
         in anything else. I should like some good fresh eggs, a bottle of preserves, some
         lemons if you can get some good ones, some ginger root. Some butter would be very
         nice, it will come better in a tin can than in anything else. I would like some sugar
         too. I wish you would send a bottle of good Cider Vinegar also-
         
         I would like some pickled onions, and some dried apples. Some prepared chocalate would
         taste(?) first rate, as we do not get good tea and coffee.
         
         A towel and a couple of handkercheifs will be very acceptable also. If there is any
         room for anything else I wish that you would fill it up with onions and good sound
         apples that are not quite ripe that they will keep better. Direct to the care of Capt. Sanford, Co C, 7th Regt. Conn Vols. _____ DD Tompkins Esq Asst. Q M General No 6 State St. N.Y. Please send it as soon as possible.
         
         I have not heard from you since I have been here but should like to do so every mail.
         If convenient please send $5.00 the next time you write.

      <p><u>Dear Sister Mary</u></p>
      <p>
         I take this opportunity of writing these few lines to let you know that I am well
         and hope you and all the rest are the same. We are still at the same place and not
         doing much in the fighting line. A part of McCalls division next to us on our right
         had a Battle with the enemy last friday and the rebels were routed with severe loss.
         It was not our luck to be in the muss we were drawn up in line of Battle impatiently
         listening to the cannonading and waiting for our General who was at Washington he
         came back on full gallop but the fight was then over however he was highly pleased
         to see us out so ready and such good numbers we gave him three cheers and says he
         boys you turn out some when there is a prospect of a fight if you dont on drill says
         he I thought you were a whole Division. The fact is so much drilling is about played
         out and we play the old Soger(?) all ways to get rid of it.
         We ran out 3 or 4 miles yesterday expecting a fight but we came across no rebels the
         Majors Orderly saw fifteen rebel Cavalry thats generally our luck we go out cheering and in the
         best of spirits and come back cussing and swearing we have had very fine weather but
         to day it is pretty rough and a little snow falling no more at present but remain
         your Affectionate Brother
