Cousin Luther,

I am injoying good health and hope this will find you injoying the same. John Sanborn is in the hospital at Beaufort Hospital No 9. I have a letter from him every week he is a getting along first rate. They have promoted John to Corporal he dont know it yet. I am going to write to John to night I am going to direct it Corp. Sanborn he wont know what it means. They have commenced on Fort Sumter again. They have been bombarding it for five days and nights. I was on picket at Fort Gregg yesterday. They shot away the flag on Fort Sumter twice the first time they shot it away a Reb come up on top of the fort and begun to wave it and put the flag up in the afternoon they shot is away again. When the Reb come up to put it up away went our guns at him bang bang bang. I guess that fellow went to his long home. They havnt put up the flag yet. They will charge on it before many days. Fitzgerald has got his discharge and gone home perhaps you will hear about him before you get this. I dont think of anything more to write this time so I will close.

From your cousin

H. B. Morrison
