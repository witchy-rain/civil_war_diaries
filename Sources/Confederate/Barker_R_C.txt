B, 42nd North Carolina Infantry] came to hand last night. I was glad to hear from home. I recd the comfort & gloves I send the comfort back for I think they do more harm than good You need not send my over coat for I have enough to carry now there is a pistol in our Co for sale if I can get it for less than one ($100) hundred Dollars I will send it by the Lieut.
