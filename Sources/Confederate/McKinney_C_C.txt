R. Smiths as muddy in my life as they are here. we have pitched our tents a gain but how long we will remain I cant say but I think we will move forward in a day or two if the wether remains fair the sun shined part of yesterday and to day for the first time in ten days I dont think there has been more than 4 or 5 days without Rain this month I never wanted to see fair wether so bad in all my time I am getting along verry well plenty to do and verry little to eat provisions are getting verry scarce we never have more than one or 2 days Rations at a time and no grain for my horse (Tomfer) I turn him out on Crabtrees pasture and there he gets the first Blue grass that ever grew to eat and more of it than ever
