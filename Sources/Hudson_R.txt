Headquarters

133 Reg. Ind.

Bridgeport, Ala

July 13th, 1864

Dear Nephew,

I have just seen Cap. Cowgil & learned where I could reach you by a letter. I was much pleased to hear your Captain speak so favorably of you as a brave soldier. Indeed he speaks in the highest terms of you. Don't be rash do your duty as a soldier, but donâ€™t necessarily expose yourself. Many a brave man has loss his life by an unnecessary exposure of his person. Be brave but not reclesly, dashing but prudent, heroic but always exercising sound judgement & discretion.

I have been here, at this port, for near two months, in command of the 133 Reg. one hundred days men. I will be in Chattanooga in a few days and will try & get down to the front. However this is very uncertain.

We leave here, on our return home about the middle of August & in the mean time, I hope to get a letter from you. But if you do not get this soon, direct to Terre Haute, for I will be there after September.

I do not forget the talk we had when I last saw you & in proper time will exert all the influence I have in your favor.

Hoping you are well, and will continue well, I remain

Your uncle,

R. Hudson
